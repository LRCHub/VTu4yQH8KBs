Your mama don't dance
And your daddy
don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy
don't rock and roll
When evening comes around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll
Well, the old folks say
That ya gotta end
your date by ten
If you're out on a date
And you bring it home late
it's a sin
You know there's no excusin'
You know you're gonna lose and
never win
I'll play it again
And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy
don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy
don't rock and roll
When evening comes around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll
You pull into a drive-in
And find a place to park
You hop into the backseat
Where you know
it's nice and dark
You're just about to move in,
Thinkin' it's a breeze
There's a light in your eyes
And then a guy says
"Out of the car, Longhair"
"Louise, you're comin' with me
And no more movies"
And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy
don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy
don't rock and roll
When evening comes around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll
Where do you go
To rock and roll
Where do you go
To rock and roll
