Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Evening comes round and ya gotta go to town, where ya go.

I said the old folks say that ya gotta be in by ten, Lawd!
the old folks say that ya gotta be in by ten
Kick off your shoes, you always lose, you never win
And it's all because.

Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Evening comes round and ya gotta go to town, where ya go
Let it go one time.

Driving down the back road, find a place to park
Jump into the backseat, ya know it's nice and dark
Just about the time, your thinking it's a breeze
A light in your eyes, and somebody says
"Hey Louise", LAWD it's the police
Your coming with me and it's all because.

Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Evening comes round and ya gotta go to town, where ya go
Take it away, one more time.

Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Evening comes round and ya gotta go to town, where ya go
Rock and roll, rock and roll...
